## Instructions:

### Back up your ROM before doing custom build. This is very important

Have the SkillSystems_20201128 patch installed in your ROM  

Place your most updated hacked ROM into the custombuild folder and name it "Input.gba"  

Make whatever edits you need  

Run Skill Custom Build in FEBuilder  

FEBuilder will likely ask to uninstall some patches. You might have to allow it to, you might be able to get away with not uninstalling the patches.  
I suggest you err on the side of caution, and let FEBuilder uninstall the patches.  

NOTE: It's a good idea to do a custom build early in your project to reduce the chance of anything breaking
