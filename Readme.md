## Instructions:

### Back up your ROM before doing custom build  
This is very important

Have the SkillSystems_20201128 patch installed in your ROM  

Place your most updated hacked ROM into the custombuild folder and name it "Input.gba"  

Make whatever edits you need  

Run Skill Custom Build in FEBuilder
