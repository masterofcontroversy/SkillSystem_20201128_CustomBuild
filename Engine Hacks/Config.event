//#define ENABLE_SLAYER_AND_EFFECTIVENESS_REWORK

// If uncommented, a full str/split will be implemented without replacing any stats
// USE_SAVE_EXPANSION will be used even if commented
// TODO: Define an item ID for Spirit Dust (Mag statbooster) in "Strmag/Str Mag Split/Installer.event". Energy Ring is used by default!
// Item icon for Spirit Dust is included! Define your icon ID in "Strmag/_Master Asm Installer.event". Default is Green Note.
#define USE_STRMAG_SPLIT

// If uncommented, will use a full (EMS-based) save expansion instead of the "old" suspend expansion
// Enabling this *will* break saves, but allows for higher stats and other things.
#define USE_SAVE_EXPANSION

// If uncommented, the fourth page of the stat screen will include personal information on the character.
// This information can be edited in the "Personal Data Editor.csv" file.

#define ENABLE_AI_STEAL_PLUS

// if commented, Steal will no longer be a skill, but a character ability, and Steal+ will require having regular steal
#define ENABLE_STEAL_SKILL

// If commented, debuffs are allowed to take stats below zero
#define DEBUFFS_MIN_ZERO

// If true Shadowgift/Lumina will check for staff ranks when checking for highest magic rank
#define SHADOWGIFT_VIA_STAFF_RANK False

//	Weapon effectiveness by default is updated via macros in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/EffectivenessSkills/EffectivenessRework.event.

//	Forager uses an external list of terrain IDs for what is considered valid for healing.
//	This list can be edited, and is located in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/HPRestorationSkills/HPRestorationSkills.event.

//	Quantum Visage pulls a mug ID from a list of 100 each time its effect is applied.
//	The list of valid IDs can be edited, and is located in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/MugLoadingSkills/MugLoadingSkills.event.

//	Identity Problems swaps between 3 pairs of name IDs and mug IDs. 
//	Each of these are external values, and can be changed in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/MugLoadingSkills/MugLoadingSkills.event.

//	These lists can be edited, and are located in
//	Engine Hacks/SkillSystem/Skills/PreBattleSkills/DoorFighter/DoorFighter.event.

//	Black Magic inflicts a random status pulled from an external list of statuses and the likelihood of their application.
//	This list can be edited, and is located in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/ProcSkills/ProcSkills.event.

//	Bargain halves prices in shops, much like a Silver Card.
//	It also includes a list of item IDs that are considered as valid Silver Cards, which can be edited in
//	SkillSystem/Skills/StandaloneSkills/Bargain/Bargain.event.

//	Amische disallows usage of any weapons not contained on a list.
//	This list can be edited, and is located in

//The growth rate ranges for each stat color and the colors themselves can be edited in
//Necessary/MSS/DisplayGrowthsOptions/GrowthColorsTable.event and NewPalette.event, respectively.
//If you are using Str/Mag Split, these are instead located in
//ExternalHacks/StrMagSplit/ModularStatScreen/DisplayGrowthsOptions.
